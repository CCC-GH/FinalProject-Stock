As these options become more likely to end up in the money it will create a lot of positive feedback momentum. Not all options buyers will exercise them but many will. Remember each 1 option = 100 shares.

Sort by VOLUME

$GME  
[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/gme/options?p=gme](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/gme/options?p=gme)  
29,097 contracts @ $800  
10,905 contracts @ $200  
10,418 contracts @ $150

This is HUGE volume. If the stock closes at $150 it can cause a chain reaction.

$BB  
[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/bb/options?p=bb](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/bb/options?p=bb)  
6,665 contracts @ $11

43,493 contracts @ $8 - WOW!  
27,299 contracts @ $9  
26,471 contracts @ $10

They can't let the price above $8!

$NOK  
[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/nok/options?p=nok](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/nok/options?p=nok)  
4,064 contracts $4  
3,417 contracts $4.50

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 1 @ 4:30PM:  
**AMC closed at $8.01 AH $8.04**  
**NOK closed at $3.92 AH $3.94**  
**GME closed at $101.74 AH $100.55**  
**BB  closed $10.05 AH $10.03**

Option holders have until 5:30PM to exercise any ITM options. Option sellers will be assigned many obligations to return shares at that price to option holders. You get two days if you don't have the shares already.

This does mean there will be some additional demand for the buying of shares Monday/Tuesday but it is not massive and I don't think it's enough to materially affect price (but what do I know).

It is very common for large banks, like JP Morgan, to sell a lot of options and their goal is for them to expire worthless. They will dump shares to achieve this, and then go long a stock again after they've expired. It's very common around earnings.

There is still A LOT of options on March 5th for GME @ $800 (29,427) @ 200 9,758.

AMC has A LOT MORE: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&amp;p=amc](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&amp;p=amc)Almost 100,000 options between $8,$9,$10,$12... So, there's a lot of potential there for momentum. Think of option interest like potential gas on the fire. It can influence price upwards, and increase volatility.

BB gang, so you're not left out, have a decent amount too. A lot of people want to see this stock north of $12.

NOK gang, there are 20,000 contracts at $4 and $4.50 for March 5th... That's a decent amount... So there's potential for momentum here too.

Catalysts for next week? Stimulus vote (which I had hoped would break today). We may also see more capital flows back to equities as the bond sell off normalizes. Growth and momentum stocks may do better (this week low momentum stocks performed best).

Everyone have a great weekend.

[Finra - AMC](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126:0P00011H0G) \-- **Short Interest**: 15.70 (some people have reported that it's not updating for them and they still see 38.12)


[Fintel - GME](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme) **-- Short interest % of Float:** 44.02  
[Fintel - AMC](https://fintel.io/ss/us/amc) **-- Short interest % of Float:** 68.48

[WSJ - GME](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GME) \-- **Short interest** **% of Float:** 41.95  
[WSJ - AMC](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMC) \-- **Short interest** **% of Float:** 66.06






**Edit 1:** As a post mentioned earlier today, Citadel has lied before about their short interest data. There is a small fine of, like, $149,000 for doing so. Paying the fine could save them billions of dollars, so it's possibly that all of the data is completely inaccurate.

**Edit 2:** Stop commenting that it's old data. We were waiting for data for the 29th. The reports are behind. This is the data that came out today, I assure you.

**Edit 3:** I usually use Fintel, not Finra, but I don’t think some of the people commenting are right in assuming the Short Interest on Finra is the % of the float. Short interest ≠ Short Interest % of Float. They are different. Some other posts that recently updated are just throwing a % sign on there and saying it's % of float

**Edit 4:** Hedge funds, if you're reading this right now, go fuck yourself.

TIME is the enemy of Wall Street. They’re running like a chicken with no head. They have to COVER and pay INTEREST!!

AS LONG AS YOU HOLD AND DONT SELL, those big dips are NOT REALIZED LOSSES! They’re just psychological losses to make you DOUBT AND SELL!

Brokers restricting PURCHASE of these stocks is creating an UNFAIR ratio of SUPPLY and due to the restriction of stock it creates a LOW DEMAND! Therefore when there’s a big supply and low demand is when the stock price goes down. However, there is A LOT OF DEMAND and that’s why they’re playing DIRTY and restricted purchase to CREATE A FAKE LOW DEMAND! That’s why there are lawsuits. 

1) HOLD AND BUY THE DIPS

2) DONT LET WALL STREET BULLY YOU

3) AS DAY PASSES WALL STREET CONTINUE TO BLEED since they have to cover and pay interest

4)HOLD AND BUY🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕

5)REMOVE YOUR STOP LOSSES❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️

6) SET LIMIT AS HIGH AS YIU CAN

7) DO NOT LOCK IN GAINS because you want to BUY DIPS. With the restriction, this strategy is not plausible

8) AMC/GME ruled out bankruptcy so your stock won’t be $0

9) DOUBLE CHECK any news or analyst or posts as they may try to scare you with fake facts. Do your own DD

10) think positive of the BIG REWARD. You CANT lose more than your total investment but  GAINS ARE LIMITLESS and this is what’s SCARING wallstreet. (Example if you invested 10k, all you would lose would be 10k but could be walking away with 100k, 1 million , 10 million depending on the resilience of all of us to BUY AND HOLD🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕)

Check out real time trade stats by googling: ""Nasdaq AMC real time trades"" and you'll see all the trade orders are 100 share volumes every millisecond. 

These are desperate hedge funds trading their stocks back and forth for a lower and lower price, driving the price down. The price drop means absolutely nothing AS LONG AS EVERYONE IS HOLDING, this will explode!

The shirts tried their damndest to drive down the share prices of both $GME and $AMC today. Specifically look at $AMC. With all that volume traded you’d expect a shitload more movement. What they got was **resistance** You could see them continuing the ladder attack after hours when YOU can’t trade. On BOTH stocks. 

The way forward is to tell them to go fuck themselves and BUY that shit up tomorrow. Let them keep punting the football back and forth to one another all day. If they can double down and play the long game SO can we. 

This is not financial advice. I’m just a retard who REALLY likes these stocks.

*IMPORTANT UPDATE*

Some people seem to be confused why the target is both $AMC and $GME. GME is currently the most shorted stock there is with 121.07 % which is a lot. That’s why it have have such impacts of people buying. But remember that they also blocked AMC and NOK out of being available to buy. And that’s because they are scared of same thing happening to AMC and NOK both of which are heavily shorted. 
Why we target AMC is because it is the SECOND most shorted stock there is: [FACT](https://www.highshortinterest.com/). 
The same thing is about to repeat itself if we hold and buy more. And to note. I’m not telling you to sell GME I’m simply telling there is maybe 3x gains to get in GME and up to 10x in AMC. Also it is more affordable stock which make it more affordable for the retailers.

It’s incredible and I couldn’t be more proud to know I have a stake in this historical moment in time with all of you. 


You see those headlines? That pushback from the big suits of wall street? WE did that. Together. If today was any indication at all, they are shitting their pants right now. I urge all of you to hold AMC and take advantage of dips if you’re inclined to do so. Please do not fall for hedge funds manipulating the market to send you into a panic sell frenzy.

That jump caused large multi-billion dollar short-selling hedge funds to short GME and AMC stock with the assumption that they'd continue to fall after their bumps.
(Short selling is when someone borrows shares at a higher price then sells it with the assumption that they can buy the shares again later (1/29) at a cheaper price, give those shares back and then pocket the difference.)
This is where we the people (FB, Reddit, Twitter..) come in to ruin their day.
A bunch of us agree to flood AND HOLD! the stock with unexpected new money, causing the stock price to rise instead of fall. This causes the short sellers to lose money because they are going to have to give back those borrowed shares in the future (1/29).
As the short sellers watch the stock rise alomg with their losses, they start folding one by one and buying the stock in order to give the shares back and close their position. Buying those shares causes the stock to rise which in turn puts MORE pressure on the short sellers and more of them have to buy more shares... This is called a SHORT SQUEEZE.
On Friday (1/29), time will be up for many of the short sellers. They'll have to close out their positions by buying stock which will cause AMC and GameStop to sky rocket.
That is why you BUY NOW (apply pressure and start your investment) and HOLD. Because every person that sells is relieving the pressure and reducing the billions of dollars the hedge funds will owe us, the little guys.

Hello friends,I just wanted to start by saying that I believe AMC &amp; GME to be under value at current prices and covid restrictions as well as NYC AMC opening back up.     NOW as we all know by now roughly about 120k+ (12 million+ shares) call options expired In The Money on Feb 26 at $8.01. The street sentiment is that AMC's price will be rising on Monday because the number of shares needed to brought to covered call options expired ITM. Fundamentally speaking that's how the price of a security goes up, buy buy and more buying, there is no exception here. If the price of AMC goes down by 20% after the HF brought million of shares to cover their calls that really wouldn't make any sense at all. That only explanation is the HF's decided to HOLDOUT for a few days so they can ladder attack to lower the price before buying million of shares to cover their calls.

Let just assumed that price spike up to between $15-$20 on Monday, this is an HF's ""Bull Trap"" so DO NOT FALL FOR IT &amp; DO NOT SELL your shares, they will be able to use your shares to increase their short interest attacks and continues their ladder attack as well. We need to decrease the number of shares available in the float NOT increase it, by selling your shares you actually increasing it. It is very important to decrease the number of shares available in the float, that's how you trigger the ""Short Squeeze"". Why would the HF's buy shares from us at $100 if they can just buy it from the float at $10 or $15 to cover their short interest? Would you?

Example:

On January 27th AMC shares jumped 300% from $4.97 to $19.90 in one day. What was the reason behind this movement? AMC raising $900 million in the week before or the CEO announcing bankruptcy is off the table? the answer is none of it, it was the classic HF's bull trap, the hf was losing so much money in GameStop they needed to make money somewhere else, they intentionally put money into AMC to raise the price so retail investors would jump in at $14-$19 thinking the price would continue to go up. We all know what happened next, AMC tanked 65% the following day and people who brought AMC in at $14-$19 were trapped, hint the ""bull trap"".

I don't know what will happen on Monday, none of us do, hopefully, AMC price will rise to $10-$11, but do NOT FALL for the Bull Trap if the price rises to $15 or $20 if you sell your shares kiss goodbye to the short squeeze. Why do you think the HF vs retail investors were battling it out over 1 cent on Friday? Literally, it was down to the last minute. Those 120k+ call options were the catalyst that we needed to pressure the hf to buyback 10 of million of shares to cover their short interest.

""(Reuters) - The U.S. government on Saturday authorized Johnson &amp; Johnson’s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine, enabling millions more Americans to be vaccinated in the coming weeks and setting the vaccine up for additional approvals around the world.""

The approval of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine couldn't happen at a better time for AMC shareholders. The last time vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech were authorized back on November 7th AMC shoots up to 90% and closed over 50% for the day. All the weeds, airlines, hotels, and housing-related stocks were also up 20%-30% as well.

A new vaccine approved and millions of shares buyback, it will be very interesting how this played out on Monday.

If you were to invest $5,000 today in $GME at the current price ($150 per share), you could purchase approximately 34 shares.  If the price of $GME were to shoot up to $500, you would make $11,900.

Now apply the same approach to $AMC.  $5,000 will currently purchase about 454 shares at $11 per share.    If the price only increases to $50 per share, your return would be $17,700.

Using the same base numbers, increase the top end numbers and see what happens:

$GME hits $750 per share - $20,400 profit

$AMC hits $100 per share - $40,406 profit 

————————————

$GME hits $900 per share - $25,500 profit 

$AMC hits $200 per share - $85,806 profit

As of today, right now, I believe the much better play is $AMC.

Edit:  I’m not saying to abandon GME. After yesterday’s activities, I saw a bunch of people asking which stock to buy and as of today, I believe AMC is the stock of choice.  The average investor can still afford to buy into AMC, which could help drive the volume needed for a squeeze.  AMC - 84% short interest and over 120,000 calls under $9 that are more than likely going to be exercised tomorrow.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First off this message is not financial advice. I just wanted to inform people of future catalyst that we are about to hit.

AMC is hyped and I don't see it stopping anytime soon. I suggest you to buy as much as you can within a value that you are comfortable sitting on for the next month. I think there is a potential for huge returns. We have multiple events that could work as catalysts for some significant future gains.

Here they are:

* FINRA reports (2/25 release): this will help us confirm if there is still an opportunity for a short squeeze
* Q4 Earnings (3/5 release): this could cause a huge spike in buys since I expect to see an uptrend in revenue due to states opening back up. Also keep in mind the last bump allowed AMC to pay off a bunch of their built up debt caused by COVID-19 closing
* COVID-19 vaccines: large number of people are getting the vaccine which will cause a surge in hope for the light at the end of the tunnel. Yesterday we saw what happened when NYC announced re-opening of all of their theaters to 25%

I repeat this is not financial advice and I don't want you to buy due to FOMO but I think this bet has a good short term and long term play. Short term is we get a nice short squeeze. Long term is the stock settles to over $20 like its competitors. The worlds largest theater chain should not be trading for 1/4 of its competition.

If you want to play it relatively safe then please only invest money that will not needed for at least a year. This way you can play the short and long game.

Love you all! I hope this is prosperous for you all and any money troubles you have can be washed away! Go get them apes!

EDIT 1:  I forgot to mention that AMC just released their own streaming service that will allow you to watch blockbuster movies from you home. Having a streaming platform could work as an additional catalyst for gains.

EDIT 2:  I accidently linked the wrong AMC streaming service.

EDIT 3:  I updated the earning report release date and added links to AMC MarketWatch and Fintel data

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It looks like the squeeze is starting to happen!  For all of you that joined in on this post thank you and for those of you saying to short AMC definitely is shitting in their pants right now.

I made the worst mistake jumping on the AMC trend and it shattered my portfolio. Pretty much what I deserve from following the trend and deviating from my strategy, but it’s demoralizing to say the least. My portfolio went from up 110% to down 50%, so I’ve lost half my original investment. 

Since then, I can’t seem to do anything correct to get back green. Each day I’m losing more and getting more discouraged. 

Any advice from people who have been in a similar situation, lost a bunch of gains and are currently negative? 

It took me like 6 months to get over that “FOMO” mindset. The second I followed it again, I pretty much lost it all. 

Just looking for any suggestions or advice on what I should do. Should I pull my money out for now until I get over this discouraged feeling? Should I just keep trying?

Hello, my fellow investors, i spend several hours writing this post in order to gather all information and sources together, but i think is worth it, and i will do it with the last post that [DFV](https://www.reddit.com/user/DeepFuckingValue/) leave in [twitter](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1359536195689197570/photo/1).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rgbra6uq7nh61.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0d9e79688c15ed9b2d27b23f31fea47d71884aa

First thought you might have think after seeing this image is because he was being [investigated by corrupt authorities](https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-reddit-trader-keith-gill-roaring-kitty-investigation-regulators-advisor-2021-2) for the GameStop case that in fact true, but there is something more..

&amp;#x200B;

This is the original thumbnail of a youtube video called [You Can Get More than 5 Stars in GTA 5! (Sixth Star)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VleqVNMTj04&amp;t=569s)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/em7lks3j8nh61.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19c26afd88241ba7e8e05d6ef43422e24ad7ba65

First is you can clearly see the car standing while there’s a lot of army forces is in front of him, which you can understand this as ***HOLD THE LINE.***

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z20l9wyo8nh61.png?width=1366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60b186bcbe82f6781e376ea7cdf769e70a35e114

In the minute, **9:28** of the video (Almost the time where the NYSE Open), you can read a billboard ""*Invest in the red, it's in your interest*"", clear message that we're all referring as **buy the dip**.

&amp;#x200B;

In Game, the billboard refers to buying [Maze Bank](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Maze_Bank) stocks, which you can do in game.

&amp;#x200B;

Digging even further if you use [Abstract Logic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=b4xQEXDBATw) you can realize that the logo of the maze bank is related to the logo of [Enron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron) which also is in the lore of the game too.

https://preview.redd.it/y37fw77o8nh61.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6349f93f42fc23cb7e7be739346086157d346217

The **Enron scandal** was an [accounting scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting_scandal) involving [Enron Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron), an American energy company based in [Houston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston,_Texas), [Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas). Upon being publicized in October 2001, the company declared [bankruptcy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy) and its accounting firm, [Arthur Andersen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Andersen) – then one of the [five largest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_auditors) [audit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit) and accountancy partnerships in the world – was effectively dissolved. In addition to being the largest bankruptcy reorganization in U.S. history at that time, Enron was cited as the biggest audit failure.

&amp;#x200B;

**Resume:** [DFV](https://www.youtube.com/c/RoaringKitty) [twitter](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1359536195689197570/photo/1) post say, buy in the red and hold, this might be one of the biggest frauds in history, cause we know there's high probability that the SEC ([stocks pushed by HF bots](https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-sec-finally-says-enough-to-one-social-media-fueled-trade-51613135287) later promoted on WSB to make us lose $ and tell we're “manipulating” those stocks) and some brokers might involved in this.

When brokers as Robinhood and others shut down trades in the retail side, the price drop from 450+ to $50 (where is right now), **with no volume.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t056wc819nh61.png?width=606&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e5f3cbd51ac523ac46a0e08dc5223d497992495

Not only that, the volume has been dropping over the week that means all our diamond hands are holding.

Which mean they’re doubling the bet manipulating the market to scare retail investors ( well...paper hands) to sell, that's something they always do to profit from shorting and bring those business down, and,  in the process, some even go bankrupt, but isn’t working for them this time, cause we’re not selling, we know what they are doing.

Let’s remember all their market manipulation strategies: [short laddering](https://marketrealist.com/p/short-ladder-attacks-explained/), [naked shorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_short_selling), [long calls](https://www.theoptionsguide.com/long-call.aspx) so synthetic cover, [media manipulation](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/silver-is-the-new-target-for-reddit-traders-three-experts-weigh-in.html), [front-running](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frontrunning.asp), [shut down](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/buying-stocks/articles/robinhood-was-flooded-with-negative-reviews-and-google-deleted-them/) ONLY retail side, [pay bots and paper hands](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lj3fqd/we_are_looking_to_pay_people_to_post_negative/) to spy and [insult us](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/lisjk1/amc_i_think_we_might_be_doing_something_right/) and send negative sentiment all this is [market manipulation](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/market-manipulation), **all this is illegal**, where is the SEC there ?

For all the global crisis, for all the families who lose somebody who get desesperated and $rope after he lose all in 2008 (nobody went to prison for that), for all the business they make go bankrupt, for all the money HF have been stealing from retail investors through [illegal tactics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frontrunning.asp) as the ones we see all this weeks and for years, this is our moment to make them pay for all the did.

I know when this start to show the real value a lot of us are going to want to sell to recover the initial invest, but remember there's fellow who put their live savings at $400+ don't make them fall, we are here against corruption and [market manipulation](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/li50zh/wsb_has_been_infiltrated_by_hedge_funds/).

&amp;#x200B;

I’m willing to lose all if this stop those greedy people to keep [stealing from us](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frontrunning.asp), keep throwing business and then flex on us with new mansions, new supercars, new private jets, new yachts, this is a legal (*illegal if you know what they are doing*) daylight robbery.

&amp;#x200B;

We’re not alone, there is massive hedge funds like BlackRock, [Vanguard](https://twitter.com/Vanguard_Group/status/1360227178185691137), in our side, do you think they buy [AMC](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=AMC&amp;subView=institutional) and [GME](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=GME&amp;subView=institutional) stocks to lose money?, they probably know something that we don't

&amp;#x200B;

**Legal Fightback Strategy:**

\- **HOLD THE LINE.**

\- Try to [contact all the authorities](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/ljfiyy/letter_to_congress/) you can, congress, [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/), we need to make pressure to investigate all this market manipulation and corruption case (Citadel, Melvin, Robinhood, SEC, etc.), the responsible need to go to jail for this.

\- If you lose money in Robinhood when they shut down trades (*we all lose money in that let’s be real and together billions*), or don't receive support to transfer your money in order to ditch it, cancel your account with all your money in it for no reason, etc, put a lawsuit or join the class lawsuit and expose all the case to your local authorities, those dogs are laughing at us in [twitter](https://twitter.com/RobinhoodApp/status/1358611669446914050) trying to look like the good ones, we need those fake brokers to go down, they sell our orderflow to the corrupt HF, so they do [front-running](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frontrunning.asp) and steal from us, no more robbery.

\- Don't waste your time sending reports to the SEC about this case, these corrupt dogs are in HF side too, if not, they would have already done something against all the market manipulation they did.

\- No sell GME neither AMC [until we get what we deserve,](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lkal7q/warning_there_are_several_people_trying_to/) at the end, is the money they have been stealing from us, not lower after they conducted a daylight robbery for years.

\- Finance laws need to be updated to the new era in order to avoid corrupt HF like these ones keep destroying business and keeps stealing from us.

\- Downvote all bots and infiltrates HF posting negativity to hide them and report it to the mods to be permanently banned.

\- If somehow, they get to seduce mods in WSB legit left subs ([WSBN](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/), [WSBE](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/), [GME,](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/) ) and post start being weird and cringe like WSB right now, we will create another sub and if necessary, or our own web page so don't worry.

\- Leave [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets) so you don't get brainwashed by corrupt mods and HF stocks.(if you buy those stocks they see you as stupid, they just push and dump to keep taking your money)

\- We need **ALL** WSB mods **REMOVED** those corrupted disgusting dogs they sell us like product for money to the corrupted HF, we need our main sub back and new algorithms to block bots.

\- Keep doing and posting when you do charity with your tendies in name of WSB, to let the world know we are here making the difference so they will see the fake media.

\- In the Congress hearing let's try to get a lot of attention thought all social media so the people will see the reality, they have been brainwashed all this weeks by fake media.

\- No more High-Frequency Trading, in most cases is just a sophisticated way to call [front-running](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frontrunning.asp).

\- We need a new public institution in charge of regulating the market, to much power in the economic market is what allow them to do this massive robbery for years.

\- If somebody can [send this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/lifb1g/psa_writing_to_your_congressmanwoman_works_aoc_is/) to our queen [AOC](https://twitter.com/aoc) or someone involved in the finances let's proposal that all stocks need to be in [blockchain](https://forum.cardano.org/t/cardano-foundation-ceo-says-blockchain-could-prevent-gme-type-showdowns/46924) or something, in order to verify shares and stop this illegal market manipulation, is a no sense that there’s more than 100% shorted or in holding, if we buy a stock is ours, 👉 [nobody can borrow and short what is not theirs](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1354890601649610753) . 👈

Currently down 72.55%, still hanging on. AMC has mitigated bankruptcy so I’ll make it back sooner or later, but not gonna lie having diamond hands is rough some days. I dedicated a pretty small portion of my portfolio to AMC/GME and am still holding. Dumped in $2.7k sitting at a whopping $730 as of writing this. We get new short interest numbers today after market close, if this is still above 80% I believe we’ll see a rebound. So I’ll keep holding

Position: 107 shares &amp; 15 AMC $20c 2/26 contracts. And 45 GME @ $80.12 avg, holding out there too

Edit: stop telling me to sell. I’m not a pussy and would rather lose 100% than sell and admit I made a mistake

Edit 2: to the guy who said “AMC just sells overpriced popcorn and the ability to sit in a seat” but who’s comment was deleted: Uhh, yeah. No shit Sherlock. Glad ur starting to realize how movie theaters work. But people keep paying for that overpriced popcorn and sit in those seats. This is not financial advice but, if people miss that stale popcorn and overpriced candy (candy the real cash cow here) once C*vid is over, maybe it’ll go back up. And the more bag holders there are, and the more hedges short, the higher likelihood we see a short squeeze in the future. Maybe. Situations like this is just a roulette table but there’s a small weak magnet under all the numbers where we lose money. Go look it up if you want, or laugh at my pain, I genuinely could not care less

I already mentioned this here, but there are probably hedge funds who haven't shorted Gamestop who gauged the insane market sentiment of retail investors. So they rode the BB/AMC/NOK/GME wave, and then pulled out leaving retail as the bag holders.

But unlike AMC, NOK and GME, BB finally broke out of the correlation, and traded upward today. Which is a good sign and maybe due to the common sentiment that it's very undervalued and potentially has a very bright future with the IoT and EV market.

Fidelity Research gives it an average analyst score rating of 8.9/10 (9-10 is in the very bullish range), with the most notable analyst being Zacks Ranking. Seeking Alpha seems to place it at a fair value price of around $15-17. It's now around $12. Let's see how this plays out.

TIME is the enemy of Wall Street. They’re running like a chicken with no head. They have to COVER and pay INTEREST!!

AS LONG AS YOU HOLD AND DONT SELL, those big dips are NOT REALIZED LOSSES! They’re just psychological losses to make you DOUBT AND SELL!

Brokers restricting PURCHASE of these stocks is creating an UNFAIR ratio of SUPPLY and due to the restriction of stock it creates a LOW DEMAND! Therefore when there’s a big supply and low demand is when the stock price goes down. However, there is A LOT OF DEMAND and that’s why they’re playing DIRTY and restricted purchase to CREATE A FAKE LOW DEMAND! That’s why there are lawsuits. 

1) HOLD AND BUY THE DIPS

2) DONT LET WALL STREET BULLY YOU

3) AS DAY PASSES WALL STREET CONTINUE TO BLEED since they have to cover and pay interest

4)HOLD AND BUY🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕

5)REMOVE YOUR STOP LOSSES❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️

6) SET LIMIT AS HIGH AS YIU CAN

7) DO NOT LOCK IN GAINS because you want to BUY DIPS. With the restriction, this strategy is not plausible

8) AMC/GME ruled out bankruptcy so your stock won’t be $0

9) DOUBLE CHECK any news or analyst or posts as they may try to scare you with fake facts. Do your own DD

10) think positive of the BIG REWARD. You CANT lose more than your total investment but  GAINS ARE LIMITLESS and this is what’s SCARING wallstreet. (Example if you invested 10k, all you would lose would be 10k but could be walking away with 100k, 1 million , 10 million depending on the resilience of all of us to BUY AND HOLD🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕)

Due to the exponential increase in membership in WSB I have started to see a lot of misinformation, favoritism, and overall divisiveness going on within the community. I decided to do my own Due Diligence (DD) to determine which stocks I will be holding next week, and hopefully this can start up a meaningful conversation in the comment section to help out our new friends who mostly want to know what to invest in.  I pulled the top 15 stocks with the greatest Options Volume from Friday (1/29). You can see all 4 of the $BANG stocks make this list. Despite understanding that GME is a heavily shorted stock with a Short Float greater than 100%, it is important to look at the Put Volume as well. This is the numbers of option contracts that are shorting the stock. GameStop is the only company of the batch that has a Short Float of greater than 100%, which is why this short squeeze is working so well, but it’s also the most heavily shorted on the options side. I think it’s important to see all 4 of the BANG stocks are heavily shorted on the put side too. If you look up who is buying these Put Contracts, it is mostly big institutional investors, whose best interest is to artificially depress the stock price so their puts pay out (look at what happened to BB and NOK on Thursday and Friday). This is why we have to stand together as a community and embrace the $BANG index that we created.

**GME** \- This is a short squeeze. Not much to say here. Buy, hold, don’t sell.

**BB** \- This is a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze. 66% of the float (shares available) are owned by institutional investors, so while the float might seem big (550M), we are only dealing with 34% of the shares. Buy, hold, don’t sell.

**AMC** \- Also a short squeeze. The Short float isn’t above 100% but this is still a great potential candidate.

**NOK** \- This is a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze. This is the weirdest one to me because everyone was claiming this was “bot” propaganda last week and then has the 3rd highest option volume on Friday. Not sure how to feel about this one, but hey its popular.

**Defining some terms:**

**Short Float:** Percentage of shorted shares in relation to the total number of floated shares (shares available to be traded)

**Options Volume:** Total number of **option** contracts bought and sold for the day

**% Put:** Percentage of total option contracts that are puts (think the stock will go down)

**% Call:** Percentage of total option contracts that are calls (think the stock will go up)

**Put/Call Ratio:** Ratio of puts to calls option contracts (higher the ratio, higher the short %)

**FAQ:**

182,2021-01-29,0.0,l8brqg,t3,4191.0,"Let’s break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when it’s time to close the positions of shorted shares and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today’s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short position will have to close in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they’re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn’t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008.  And, who can forget our grandson GME? 

AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there’s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we’re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday.

1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it’s going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when shorts have to close their positions and as a result of that they themselves take the price higher.

More by u/Common-Buy-2379 in comment section:

AMC is also 49.85% owned by a Chinese holding company. This company controls over 75% of voting shares indirectly, through controlling interest in subsidiaries that also own shares.

They will NOT be bailing out the hedge funds, which would dilute their ownership in the company. They will not be floating their shares for sale during the squeeze.

In all likelihood, the upcoming stock issuance will be sold to larger firms with little interest in assisting the hedges, and will probably remain within Chinese control.

Not financial advice, I just read the 10-k, 8-k, and 10-q, because I like this stock. Also tendies. I love tendies.

To illustrate, If the Chinese owned shares aren't available to fill the shorts, then there's only 13M shares to fill the 44M shorts.

It's WAY shorter than people think.

Positions: 

- 1700 AMC shares balls deep @ 18$ average (~30K)
- 6c AMC 19/3 (10 contracts)

Edit: Earlier I had “shorts expire” in this post which seemingly drew some people crazy ignoring other important aspects. I meant to say when shorts will have to cover their positions. Edited in post.

184,2021-01-29,0.0,l8efqp,t3,8438.0,"As we all know, AMC is the [second most shorted stock in existence](https://www.highshortinterest.com/), behind only GME of course. However, the actual situation between the two companies could not be more different. GME was never really at risk of bankruptcy. GME always had more cash than debt and was paying back debts ahead of schedule, because it has a flexible business model where it can easily close down underperforming stores, which GME did in large numbers this past year. In place of the underperforming stores, GME is expanding furiously into e-commerce. With RC now at the helm strategically, its future is bright.

AMC is in the exact opposite situation. It operates theaters, which it cannot close down without permanent, serious consequences. There is very little room for AMC to cut operating losses during the pandemic. There is no e-commerce pivot. It has theaters, and that's it. For a while now, AMC has been teetering on the edge of a cliff, facing a massive debt load and mounting operating losses, while hedge funds were relentlessly building short interest on its stock like a flock of locusts. AMC had been just a step away from Chapter 11 several times. The shorts almost won.

****This is where we come in.****

The recent rise in AMC's stock price is not just a middle finger to the short interest hedge funds. It is a lifeline to the **real world** operations of AMC. A few days back, one of AMC's debt holders [converted $600 million worth of debt into stock](https://deadline.com/2021/01/amc-entertainment-silver-lake-swaps-debt-for-equity-as-cinema-chains-stock-surged-1234682417/), and there were additional share offerings and other debt conversions.

&gt;It an SEC filing this morning, AMC said it will be issuing around 44.4 million shares of Class A common stock to Silver Lake and related noteholders in the transaction, which will reduce its debt by $600 million.

&gt;Earlier this month, AMC stockholder Mudrick Capital Management also swapped AMC debt for equity, in this case 14 million shares, plus another 8 million as a fee for separate loan.

&gt;As part of its recently announced fundraising, AMC yesterday finished issuing a further $300 million of equity at $4.80 a share.

&gt;It’s been a wild ride for the nation’s largest exhibitor but CEO Adam Aron told Deadline Monday that the chain should have cash enough to ride out the year.

Now, a valid concern might be that the additional stock offerings will increase float and ease the pressure on the shorts. But that didn't happen! The good news aspect of these moves significantly outweighs the additional float. With the freedom to raise capital and reduce debt load, the threat of bankruptcy is all but gone. The shorts will not win anymore, it's just a matter of how much they lose. 

This movement is legitimately saving a real American company. This is not patriotic jingoism. AMC, by the nature of its business, employs US residents and supports local economies across the entire country. AMC is a huge corporation but at the same time extremely local and intimate. The vast majority of its screens are in the US, with a solid representation in Europe as well. Yeah, the popcorn is overpriced, but at least it's going into the pockets of US residents and circulating in the local economy. 

And the enemy? Bloodsucking vampire hedge funds who literally produce NOTHING and do NOTHING except amass capital through underhanded and despicable means. 

This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to smash those hedge funds and save a beloved company at the same time.

208,2021-02-26,0.0,ltenie,t3,1227.0,"(Trey's Trades here) - get this guys, let's do some quick configuration:

Gamma squeezes can be thought of very simply:

\-Buyers purchase contracts from Market Makers

\-Buyers gamma (essentially, potential to make money) goes up as the stock continues to climb and more call options are bought

\-Market makers, or the sellers, gamma initially goes down, and they want to mitigate this risk

\-If MANY people buy a crap ton of call options, the gamma goes up exponentially for retailers

\-If MANY people buy a crap ton of call options, the gamma goes down exponentially for market makers

&amp;#x200B;

\-Two things potentially happen:

1. Market makers hedge on the climb up by purchasing shares to raise their gamma and risk to lose money
2. Options expire ITM (in the money, or above the signified strike price), and option holders have the obligation to purchase the shares tied to their call options

Both these things drive the price up, so where am I going with this?

&amp;#x200B;

GME BEGAN ITS INSANE RUN-UP BECAUSE OF THIS BASIC, AND RIDICULOUSLY SIMPLE FUNDAMENTAL PHILOSOPHY! GME had a crap ton of call options purchased, raising gamma for retailers, dropping gamma for market makers, and they hedged on the climb up, raising price. Inevitably, call options expired in the money, raising price, AND LEADING to an eventual short squeeze.

DON'T FREAK OUT if AMC doesn't moon first thing in the morning. The setup is there. Stay convicted.

AMC has the same, exact, setup. Unusual options trading. 93.9% short utilization according to Ortex as of today. Low available short shares. The table is set, and all it'll take is a couple apes to keep eating some bananas.

239,2021-02-20,0.0,lolbz5,t3,963.0,"Hello everybody, and thanks in advance for reading this; in this post I will lay out the case for AMC being able to hit 2000 USD based on current trends, short interest, apes holding, failure to deliver data and possible media attention.

The following paragraphs will layout the sources, as well as ground work for the fundamentals of this stock and what we know:

So lets begin, with the weekends end price 5.70; the price for AMC right now has solid support at 5.50 due to apes holding and buying up any phantom shares created by using calls (these synthetic shares are then borrowed by Hedge funds, diluting the the share pool, lowering the price at which they profit from shorts, however you beautiful apes have bought up those shares, and now they owe them to you; adding more fuel to the rocket).

This following source elaborates more on phantom shares: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng4oigy9\_kQ&amp;t=4s&amp;ab\_channel=GrowtoAttain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng4oigy9_kQ&amp;t=4s&amp;ab_channel=GrowtoAttain)

Now let us discuss the short interest, right now there are a lot of conflicting sources of information with the exact short interest, such as with finrar, fintel, market watch and ortex; for the sake of this discussion we shall go with ortex, as well as market watch (via trey's trade: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SbyBuzoxeI&amp;list=PLZIPt\_aSfEw0wAV5cMTWqoaLWo1l0PQ-R&amp;index=15&amp;ab\_channel=Trey%27sTrades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SbyBuzoxeI&amp;list=PLZIPt_aSfEw0wAV5cMTWqoaLWo1l0PQ-R&amp;index=15&amp;ab_channel=Trey%27sTrades))

The data with ortex had the short utilization rate 91% (the amount of shorts that had been lent out, out of the possible pull was at 91% on feb 6th during short interest reporting).

Market watch had reported at the same time the short interest was 66% (rumors on reddit that I couldn't verify is that the actual short interest is over 100% using retail etfs, similar to GME), and furthermore amc still has a short volume of 66% on market watch ([https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc)), making it still one of the, if not highest in the world interms of short volume. As such I think we can confidently state that the short interest is at least &gt; 66%, best case above 100% already.

Now lets go over apes holding:

I understand there has been some confusion about whether 99.2% of the shares are actually being held; I'll be honest I can't verify that; here's what I can verify though, there is a high inflow within the stock for this quarter as well most apes are buying and holding; with [capital.com](https://capital.com/) ([https://capital.com/amc-entertainment-holdings-cl-a-share-price](https://capital.com/amc-entertainment-holdings-cl-a-share-price)) saying there are currently a 96/4 buy to sell ratio, this is backed up by fund inflows as show by market beat, as it shows massive inflows ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/institutional-ownership/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/institutional-ownership/)), backed up by a litany of institutional buyers like Vanguard, Blackrock, Charles swab, Morgan Stanley (the list is vast and you should totally check it out for yourself in the market beat link); in other words this stock has bullish confidence behind it, with not just apes buying and holding as such it is a legitimate investment and is worth buying and holding.

Furthermore as covered above in the short interest section, the phantom shares that have been diluting the share stock pile have been continuously bought and held by apes creating the hard support at 5.50. If this trend continues the price will inevitably increase.

Now before I sum it up, lets talk about Failure to Deliver data: [https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) , [https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/ll89bo/failure\_to\_deliver\_numbers\_out\_gme\_stocks\_not/?utm\_medium=android\_app&amp;utm\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/ll89bo/failure_to_deliver_numbers_out_gme_stocks_not/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

AMC allegedly has 54 Million shares that have failed to deliver at 4.98; I think this true but we still don't know when they have to buy and what exactly are the specifics, but what this does establish is that shorts eventually will have to buy at a higher price because there will not be enough shares to buy to payback the short loan of however many shares they are shorting, if apes hold. We just don't know what exactly is going on, but we know they have to cover; due to the SEC and it maybe a minimum of 54 mill shares they have to buy back at our price; which would cause insane volume, volatility and price action if it wasn't for the short ladder attacks, we shall use this information point when talking about the feedback loop that may take effect taking AMC to 2000.

Now lets review what we know so far, there seems to be a hard support at 5.50 regardless of naked shorting by phantom shares, due to apes holding and buying. This stock has been short laddered attack to 5.50 instead of organically going down; as such has a crazy high short interest of at least above 66% in a conservative estimate; without retail etf confirmation. Most apes are holding as shown by the buy: sell ratio, regardless of the 99.2% number, furthermore there is institutional confidence for AMC as such it is not only a short squeeze candidate, but a legitimate investment and good for a long term haul (we can discuss the amazon talks later, however birdbrain investing lays out a good case for a long term stock for AMC, and why its a 20 dollar stock [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hps4yjOxJ\_Y&amp;ab\_channel=BirdBrainInvesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hps4yjOxJ_Y&amp;ab_channel=BirdBrainInvesting)).

Now that we have established the fundamentals of the arguments, lets us elaborate how AMC could get to 2k and how. Right now with most technical factors (MacD, SMA, EMA etc) ; [https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/lodanb/amc\_10\_day\_forecast\_lets\_gooooooo\_source\_pretiming/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=ios\_app&amp;utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/lodanb/amc_10_day_forecast_lets_gooooooo_source_pretiming/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

AMC is on a bull run, and will increase; this will cause more volume, volatility and recent shorts to become unprofitable; as well as litany of option chain activity if strike prices are satisfied; taking more shares off the table as well as increasing short interest as more shorts will be opened.

I believe this will continue till 20, the question is will apes hold at 20. If apes hold at 20, then the shares they need to buy back on these now unprofitable short positions will be off the market, and they will have to ask for higher prices past 20 to try to get our shares. This will trigger even more aggressive options trading, increasing the demand for the stock even more, while taking away supply; increasing the price even more, until they fail to deliver and are given X amount of time by the SEC to either by back the stock, or declare bankruptcy and let insurance cover it at whatever price we want.

As such the series of events that will happen provided apes hold is as follows:

(FOR ANYBODY THAT DIDN'T READ THE BENCH MARK CASE, HERE IS THE FEEDBACK LOOP, CASE FOR THE FEEDBACK LOOP IS GIVEN ABOVE)

Apes hold and buy ---&gt; 20 bucks eventually ---&gt; apes buy and hold ---&gt; shorts become unprofitable and need to cover (short ladder attacks will happen don't panic, this will increase short interest) --&gt; options get struck allowing more shares to be taken off the market ---&gt; higher volatility ---&gt; higher price ---&gt;apes hold and buy --&gt; 40 bucks --&gt; same cycle ---&gt; this time with failure to delivers compounding ---&gt; apes hold and buy ---&gt; 80 bucks --&gt; S.C (same cycle) ---&gt; 200 --&gt; A.H.B (apes buy and hold) and media gets involved with ""GME 2 has appeared and its called AMC"" like headlines ---&gt; buying frenzy ---&gt; 400 --&gt; more media attention, more buying failure to delivers etc --&gt; 2000, until whatever price apes mass sell and failure to deliver is met.

The bedrock of this cycle is again, if we have been doing what we have been doing; buying and holding whatever they throw at us.

Now you ask, what are your past references you may ask; excellent question lets address the VW squeeze. ([https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/72zkab/what\_happens\_in\_a\_short\_squeeze/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/72zkab/what_happens_in_a_short_squeeze/))

In short 94 % ish of the VW stock if I recall was bought and held buy a combination of Porsche and the German government with a short interest of only 13%, as such the VW investors got to dictate prices to the Short sellers that had taken out short positions on VW, causing that insane price spike from 200 euros to 1k euros. As we have established in prior sections, AMC's short interest is much higher, and most shares maybe already off the table; as such the potential for this squeeze is much higher.

However this only gets to 2000 USD or higher, if apes hold like VW investors had, and now you may ask, why shouldn't I just take my profits and run, 200 bananas is plenty for an ape if an ape bought only 5 banana's, again good question, as such I'd recommend getting your original investment back when we hit a high level before the actual rocket launch (I think AMC based on that partial feedback loop/cycle is already inevitable) ; as such the worst that can possible happen is you double or triple your money as well as effectively having a spacesuit for the rocket launch; at what price you would like to gain your original investment (I think triple digits are inevitable, quadruple digits depend on the ape troop holding) back, and gain an effective spacesuit for the rocket launch.

If most apes take some profits and buy back as well, then 2k also becomes inevitable; however as stated this is how AMC can get to 2000.

To sum it up, it depends on apes buying holding, and price volatility driving prices higher and higher, making them uncoverable, as prices will be to high and there wont be enough shares, due to more people buying and options being struck, causing an effective positive price feedback cycle that was seen in GME; however this time they can't halt trading (they will increase margin requirements though so be aware of that).

Lastly, this feedback cycle depends entirely on apes holding, so like mark cuban said; we'll see what wallstreetbets is made of (or in this case AMC apes).

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and if you have read this and are bleeding hard; thanks for holding the line; like DFV said; hang in there

This piece is purely my opinion, and should not be taken for financial advice as it displays a hypothetical price action case for AMC that may happen; as such is not financial advice.

&amp;#x200B;

\*edit, as further recommended a TLDR for crayon eaters; if apes buy and hold they have no choice but to pay whatever price we want and the fact is everybody is holding, is an excellent sign this rocket ship could hit 2k, detailed mathematical and logical arguments are given above\*

The HF's have been throwing everything they have at us. Remember them trying to scare us into believing this stock would go back to the roughly $2.00 floor it was at? They've been playing every crooked, dirty little trick they have up their sleeves to try and make that happen too. But they have been unsuccessful. APES HELD STRONG. APES BOUGHT MORE! And the result is that the price we are at now $5.50-$5.60 is the new floor we have established and held on a lateral timeline for awhile now. That is a good sign. We are winning. We didn't let them push this down. We established a new floor. SOMETHING is going to happen with this stock before to much longer. It is just a matter of time and patience. Keep being strong brothers and sisters. Our time is coming!

Disclaimer: None of the following is investment advice. Do your own research.

There's a lot of chatter about AMC and whether it'll pop or it'll dive. This is an attempt to establish the facts and figure out what's the roadmap to tendies from here on.

**tl;dr for those on a multicoloured crayon diet:**

**AMC is not dead, nor will it die anytime soon. There's plenty of positive catalysts coming up.**

**If you want to get in this play right away then better buy shares because IV is very high at the moment. $5 seems like a price floor. If you do want to buy calls I suggest Aug expiry between $7-$9, or better yet LEAPS Jan 22 at $10-$12.**

**My position is 15,000 shares at about $2.40. I'm waiting for IV to drop a bit before I buy LEAPS.**

Let's start at the beginning:

AMC is the largest movies operator in the world. It has 1,004 theatres and 11,041 screens worldwide. The biggest, by far. They made $43bn revenue for movie studios in 2019.

What we know from the Q3 2020 results:

After 5 months suspension of Operations theatres started to reopen.

First domestic theatres reopened 8/20 and int'l ones as early as June. However, most of Europe has been in lockdown since Nov/Dec 2020 and all domestics operate on a 20%-40% limited capacity. As of Oct 30th it operated 539/600 domestic locations and 261/358 int'l locations.

Record high scores in cleanliness of theatres.

March 2020 raised $900m in debt and equity. $1bn concessions from creditors and landlords, $80m asset sales.

* Q1 of 2020: drew down $325m from existing credit lines
* April 2020: issued $500m of debt due 2025. Suspended cash repurchase and dividends. Received $7m in tax cash refunds
* July 2020: debt exchange reduced debt by $555m, reduced interest expenses by $120m for one year (up to July 2022), extended maturities on $1.7bn of debt until 2026 and issued $300m of new debt due 2026.
* August 2020: sold Baltic region theatres for $77m.
* Sept 2020: sold 15m shares for $56.1m.
* Oct 2020: sold another 15m shares for $41.6m.
* Dec 2020: Prepared 50m shares for issuance, should they need to. Total shares outstanding on Dec 28 2020 were 164m Class A and 51.8m Class B.
* Jan 2021: Total shares outstanding as of Jan 22 2021 were 287,276,58 Class A and 51.8m Class B (Class B can't be sold unless converted to Class A).
* Jan 27th: SLA converts debt into equity and sells $600m worth of shares in the market. Total shares added to float: 44.4m. Debt reduced by $600m
* Feb 5th 2020: Wanda converted it's class B shares to class A shares. This means they can sell them in the market at any time now. There is no specific # on how many shares it converted, but we know it owned 51.8m of Class B shares.

Operationally they proceeded with layoffs and a series of cost cutting measures, renegotiated theatre leases, eliminate contractor roles and all sorts of expenses. **This is important as these savings will persist throughout the reopening of the theatres, so they will improve their profit margins going forward.**

**Cash position on 9/30: $417.9m**

**Total debt on 9/30: $5.82bn**

**Q&amp;A with myself**

**Are people really returning to theatres?**

Attendance was 6.5m tickets in Q3 2020 vs 87.1m in Q3 2019, representing about 7.5% of seating capacity, which was limited to about 20%-40% of total seats. While this may look like they are not utilizing their existing seating capacity, remember that theatre ops in USA were suspended for 2/3 of the 3rd quarter. I am guessing (no data) a similar restriction at the international theatres. Had ops not been suspended for 2/3 of Q3 then we'd be seeing roughly 3x the tickets, about 19.5m, or 22% of total seating capacity. That would suggest people were returning to cinemas before the end of Sept 2020. That's despite no blockbusters playing. **Only 2 films were released theatrically since mid-March to end of Sept and theatres were open mostly on weekends, so there wasn't much to watch anyway.**

**Are people spending at the theatres?**

Average ticket prices in Q3 2020 were $9.37 VS. $9.45 in Q3 2019, so pretty much the same.

In Int'l markets ticket prices were actually higher, at $9.80 vs $8.45.

Spending on food and beverage was the same in USA, at $5.35/patron in both Q3 2020 and Q3 2019, and higher in int'l markets ($4.10/patron vs. $3.59/patron in Q3 2019)

Again, that's positive in relation to how customers feel about AMC managing the cleaning of its theatres and safety practices. That level of spending suggests people are comfortable watching movies and eating/drinking in the theatres.

**From the Q3 ER call:**

The critical movie-leading markets of Los Angeles and New York City remain closed.

There has been massive focus on improving liquidity and deleveraging the balance sheet and cutting costs and spending. **A lot of those cost saving and spending cuts will continue even after revenue recovers,** which means higher profit margins, which means higher EPS, which means lower multiples to comps, which means share price will go up as it will be perceived as 'cheap'.

Stroke a deal with Universal for a PVOD window. Basically, that means that AMC will not exclusive rights to play movies for 74 days at theatres before the movie can go on video-on-demand. The time window is shortened, and after that you will have movies both on theatres and on demand online at the same time. AMC will take a cut for any movies that go on PVOD before the theatrical release period ends. As they said later in November, they have made more money with the PVOD deal than the standard exclusive theatrical release.

Theatre count in Middle East tripled in 2020, and it will further double in the first half of 2021.

Cash burn for Q3 2020 was $324m, inclusive of the costs for raising capital.

**44 major film titles have been rescheduled to play theatrically only in 2021. Once theatres reopen, say in summer, there will be a blockbuster every single week and some more.**

They have gotten out of 40 loss-making theatres in USA as well by not renewing leases.

**Breaking even?**

In 2019 AMC sold 17% of their available seats and had the biggest revenue/profit of any year ever. It all hinges to NYC and LA reopening basically as other individual theatres break even at 25% capacity. What this means is that you don't need COVID restrictions to lift fully before AMC starts making profits, you only need LA and NYC to reopen. This makes AMC a bit of a dark horse because most people will be waiting for full economy reopen before they jump at the stock, but its financials will be in the black long before then, and that means that it will most likely surprise upwards on ER going forward and exceed wallstreet's expectations.

**Innovation. Ok, they will reopen, but will they grow?**

They have launched a private theatre rental program, where you can book the whole auditorium. They have had 80,000 incquiries about it, and that's with a soft launch (no press releases yet or advertising).

There have been a lot of articles in the second half of 2020 about Amazon or Netflix partnering or buying them out. That would drive the price high instantly. Bear in mind that the streaming giants are facing pressure on growing their market share and AMC makes perfect sense. Also, given their balance sheets the financial risk of buying AMC out at roughly $2bn market cap is negligible.

**Won't streaming kill the movie theatres?**

No, absolutely not. AMC provided $43bn of revenue to film makers in 2019. No studio will forgo that kind of revenue. In fact, from the pilot testing of PVOD they've done, it's actually more lucrative for both theatres and studios to have a short exclusive theatrical release followed by concurrent streaming, than either/or. It's a new model of releasing movies and a much more profitable one. In summary, streaming will actually increase profits for AMC, not take away any.

**Ok, that may be true for the big blockbuster Avenger-type movies, but what about smaller releases? won't they be best stream-only?**

No, they have tested the PVOD deal with small releases (e.g. Kajilionaire which made under $10m revenue in cinemas) and the combined profit for studios/AMC was higher than the older model or what it'd have done streaming alone.

**Analyst ratings:**

According to marketbeat: 4 sell and 6 hold

AMC has the lowest, by far, P/E ratio against its competitors. This means it is perceived as cheap.

**Earnings date: 25 Feb**

&amp;#x200B;

**Major shareholders:**

* Blackrock 2.9% (increased it's position by 70%)
* Vanguard 4.5% (reduced its position slightly by -5%)
* Mittleman 1%
* Norther Trust 0.5% (increased position by 40%)
* Stifel 0.2% (increase position by 285%)
* Bank of NY Mellon 0.2%
* Wells Fargo 0.15%
* Charles Schwab 1% (increased its position by 10%)
* Goldman Sachs 0.6% (increased position by 160%)

**Risks:**

Further dilution in case AMC decides to sell more shares. This can be avoided if theatres start reopening faster or attendance picks up. With vaccinations underway in USA we should soon hear about LA and NYC reopening (NYC already lifte some restrictions in hospitality). People are worried about dilution, but do remember that shareholders were happy to pay high prices for those shares, so they believe they bought in cheap, and they aren't all idiots.

Debt holders pushing hard on AMC. However, this is unlikely to their benefit as any restructuring will take forever and they stand to lose a lot through a prolonged asset sale. It's preferable for debt holders to convert debt to equity and sell - and for that they'd need a good/high stock price.

Further COVID lockdowns because of new variants or whatnot

&amp;#x200B;

**Catalysts**:

Definite: Vaccination roll out means NYC and LA announce reopening of theatres soon.

Possible: Esports partnerships

Who knows: Buyout or partnership with Netflix, Amazon or Disney

**Other**

* Short interest remains high, I believe it was around 68% on 1/31, but someone may correct me if I got this wrong. In any positive newsflow the shorts will be pressed a bit.
* People are gagging to go to the cinema, AMC has had it's best revenue year after year up to 2019. They are not a dying business by any stretch of the imagination.

1. Denial - There's absolutely no way this stock will not squeeze! The short squeeze is coming, it's just as matter of time. It's happening, and I will not accept no for an answer.    

2. Anger - These POS Hedgefund bullies, forever taking our piece of the pie. Where's the fairness in all of this? Where is God? Why is this happening?  

3. Barganining -  What if AMC become digital? What if AMC is purchased by Amazon or Netflix? Errr post pandemic we will see movie theatres open again and it will rise, everyone loves the cinema. Also.....sHoRt LaDdEr aTacKS   

4. Depression - Is there any point to this any more? I feel robbed and all I want to do is sleep. Everytime I look at the charts I feel like crying myself to sleep whilst eating chocolate.   

5. Acceptance - I'm ok with this, I'm a doofus. I joined a hype train, made a huge mistake. I will learn from this and just HOLD until I can make my money back or take a 30% loss. Whatever, it is what it is.

Why does AMC keep going down even if we are holding? Because of MARKET MANIPULATION. Hedge funds know a way to trick the algorithm so that the numbers keep going down. They basically sell their stocks back and forth between them so that people start thinking that everybody is selling. This is known as short ladder attack (since the negative volume emulates the pattern of a ladder). 

Based on the Order Book (L2), the amount of BUY orders are way way way bigger than the amount of SELL orders. People are buying and holding, but yet the stock keeps going down. These numbers are psychological, market manipulation will not last forever and eventually the stock will skyrocket.
AMC is the most purchased stock in Robinhood right now, which is basically all you need to know. AMC is not dead, in fact is the most hyped stock right now.

Once the market manipulation stops we will win this fight. This is a patience duel. AMC is currently below negative 10%, which means SSR (Short-Sale Rule) will take place tomorrow Tuesday 9th. This means shorts will have it harder to short AMC and we have a chance to recover.

Just stay positive, the Gamestop phenomenon took 5 weeks to happen. And even if AMC doesn't squeeze as expected, it is an over $20 stock. They have cleared debt thanks to this movement and people will go back to the movies now that the vaccine is being distributed. Also there are rumors that Amazon and Netflix would be looking to purchase AMC, which would be huge for current AMC stock holders. But these are just rumors.

STAY POSITIVE, STAY STRONG. WE LOVE THE STOCK AND WE LOVE THE MOVIES!!!! 🍿🚀🍿🚀🍿🚀🍿🚀

This is all because of the market makers so do not worry, as this is typical and was seen all last week. Even if more restrictions will hit just hold and we will bounce right back up if the consistency of the holders stay unchanged.

&amp;#x200B;

AMC going from +20% to remaining unchanged at 0% whilst GME goes to almost +10% and then remaining unchanged premarket at the exact same time will be the norm the coming time.

&amp;#x200B;

278,2021-01-29,0.0,l8b814,t3,2569.0,"To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect AMC in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today’s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they’re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn’t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there’s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we’re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday 

My recommendation: 
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it’s going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it’s highest.",wallstreetbets,AMC heading to Mars next week buckle up everyone!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,2569.0,0.73

Hear me out here. I think Nano is going to make us all rich. It's what's gonna get us all a Tesla, plus a second Tesla to launch to Jupiter and beyond 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Altstreetbets, the crypto buddy of this holy sub, [is already dtf with this](https://np.reddit.com/r/AltStreetBets/comments/l66mhv/the_gme_case_for_nano/).

**# 1. What the f is Nano and why are you shilling this**

To keep it short for us retards: Nano is a cryptocurrency that boasts zero fees, instant transfers (sub-second), is green, and increases the size of your pp. It has a good claim to being better than Bitcoin but has 1/1500th its market cap. [Daddy Elon tweeted about whatever has least error &amp; latency will win](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1349977642708168704) \- that shit is literally what Nano is.

**# 2. We're in this together**

Apes together strong, right? Nano has a huge community, so big that most of the crypto subreddits aren't sure how to deal with the constant Nano enthusiasm. Not kidding, the banned Nanites could fill a subreddit by themselves. They're tireless on Reddit, Twitter, or anywhere else you dare utter that you pay fees for any crypto or money transfer. These are people that held through a 90% loss, then didn't sell when Nano suddenly pumped 400%. Diamond hands doesn't even begin to describe it. When the price pumped even slightly, they all jumped on it to pronounce Nano the best thing since before sliced bread, and went to town on Twitter and Reddit.

My point? **AMPLIFICATION**. As soon as Nano starts getting some price action, the Nanites will jump on it, will keep going, and they **ARE. NOT. LEAVING.**

**# 3. Rumours of Nano being suppressed**

The rumour that Nano is being suppressed by crypto miners and Bitcoin maximalists has been around for a very long time, and it makes sense. Nano works ridiculously well, and is there to eat the cake of all the miners who are raking in millions a day. BTC maxis and miners *hate* the word Nano, and have a strong incentive to literally pay to have it disappear from the face of the earth. Bitcoin influencers on Twitter have muted the word Nano because they know their thesis is fucked when it gets mentioned.

My point? **F EM**. Bitcoin is king, Bitcoin was literally birthed by the virgin Mary, and everything else is a 💩coin that doesn't deserve to pump. **F THAT**. And F maximalism in general. We're here to make money, and Bitcoin doesn't offer enough gains.

**# 4. Solid pumpamentals**

Aside from the strong community and the ridiculously good tech, it also has the other pumpamentals needed. It just got listed on AnchorUSD meaning it's now easy to buy in the US, and was recently added to KuCoin for 10x leveraged trading. Volume actively on the books on exchanges is low, right now it would take only $600k to pump it 30% on Binance pair. What else does it have as pumpamentals? The Nano team recently applied for the Coinbase listing and Coinbase just so happens to have removed pruning as a prerequisite from their website. Coincidence? Maybe, but when asked earlier Nano's lack of pruning was mentioned as the obstacle for a Coinbase listing. **COINS GETTING LISTED ON COINBASE ALWAYS PUMP BECAUSE COINBASE HAPPENS TO BUY A BUNCH OF WHATEVER THEY'RE LISTING BEFORE THEY LIST IT.**

Plus, it seems like we would have Raoul Pal from Real Vision Group in our camp. When he recently asked for altcoin recommendations the Nano Twitter shills did their job as usual, he replied to them it was a good thread. Coincidentally there was a huge (for Nano) buy order right around that time.

More pumpamentals? The Nano tagline writes itself. It transfers in the blink of an eye, it has no fees, it's greener than the big dildo that's currently fucking Melvin Capital, has the best wallet in all of crypto and can be demonstrated to anyone within a minute. It's the ultimate antidote to the high fees narrative of Bitcorn, and shames institutions for holding a CO2 emitting coal guzzler on their balance sheets through Bitcorn. As soon as the price starts going up, this thing sells itself. Hell, institutions can even buy it since recently through Bitcoin Suisse, where Nano was added because of demand. And keep in mind - this has a market cap of $450 million. Throwing $100 at Nano does more than throwing $1000 at AMC.

My point? Well, exactly the title. **SOLID PUMPAMENTALS**. Seriously this thing is so ready to be hyped.

**# 5. The plan**

Am I saying to leverage this x100 to pump it into the skies? Maybe, but also no. I am saying that whatever you do, Nano is going to pump anyway because if us retards can figure it out, others can too. This shit can be 10x leveraged on KuCoin without even needing to do KYC. I'm doing that right now, and am expecting you all to do the same. At a 3000% gain ($100) we can call this a success, if it gets to $250 I'll buy the top comment on this post a Tesla because fuck it, I'll be rich.

**My credentials?** My post karma when I posted this on another sub was 420. Due to the mass upvotes my total karma has now increased to 1337. I'm counting on this post shooting me to 42069. Need I say more?

Positivity, not disagreeing with anything I've said and more examples of solid pumpamentals (also places to leverage it more than 10x) are welcome in the comments ⬇

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1.) COVID vaccine rollout has started, and we will be able to attend movies soon. The Biden Administration (sorry for getting political, just pls keep reading) has an ambitious plan (100 million vaccines in 100 days or whatever the fuck) and this pandemic is almost over. I’d give it until the end of the year.

2.) **Most** [**AMC**](https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-ent-movie-theaters-reopening-0123-2021) **theatres** [**are open**](https://www.amctheatres.com/amc-safe-and-clean#locations) or they are planning to open soon with social distancing and mask measures in place. They will shut down the food services and concessions, but they are coming back.

3.) **Consumers have a sentimental connection to movies. They will come back**. People are starved for the outside world and will come out in massive hordes to watch movies. People will go out and see movies, take their kids, go on dates, etc. Nothing can replicate the experience of a giant screen and surround audio.

4.) This major influx of blue balled movie goers will cause a major boost in 2021. Then we will see a continuation of the year over year growth we have been seeing since 2012.

5.) The AMC business model is working. The revenue has steadily increased since 2012 year over year. [**In 2012, they made $811 million. In 2019, they made $5.47 billion.**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/206959/revenue-of-amc-theatres/) There has been a steady rise. **THEY ARE NOT IN DECLINE.**

6.) I understand they have many loans, but it is something that can be paid off in a few years with the help of their parent company, Wanda Entertainment, and increased profits in 2021.

7.) They will not go bankrupt. WANDA entertainment, a Chinese company owns the plurality share (20%) and will bail them out if it is necessary. They bought for $2.6 billion in 2012, and have seen a ROI, scoring $2.7 billion in 2013, the year immediately after their purchase. AMC is too good of an asset for Wanda to lose them. Also, AMC can take advantage of new stimulus and other government assistance programs.

8.) It’s extremely cheap right now because everybody is shorting, and there’s a pandemic. Corona is only temporary. Everybody thought GameStop was going to go under, until we showed them. Remember that.

9.) If there is interest or heightened trading in the stock, AMC can dilute shares and sell them to help finance operations and pay debt, using stock sales as leverage. AMC just did this today, and they can do it again if needed.

10.) AMC will not go bankrupt, not only because of the potential Wanda bailout, but [**they also raised $917 million today. They have enough runway to stay operational the end of the year. ""Bankruptcy is off the table for now.""**](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/25/amc-ceo-adam-aron-on-917m-financing.html) (We should be able to return to theatres by then.) A slight majority of this new liquidity comes from issuing new shares, as described in 9. They are also planning to do debt/equity swaps, so those who take out debt can hold shares in the company, and AMC won't get fucked over by high loan payments.

11.) [**AMC is about 70% shorted**](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)**, there is much potential to cause a squeeze**. However, there are still many more reasons to invest in AMC beyond a simple short squeeze.

12.) AMC does very well when it is not pandemic. $5.4 billion in revenue last year, and there will be many movies, as well as many moviegoers that come out after the pandemic. Especially with major franchise movies, which have been delayed. They [have also reached a deal with Universal, which allows Universal to do home releases earlier, but stipulates they must be in theatres for 17 days before that.](https://variety.com/2020/film/news/universal-amc-deal-theaters-pandemic-1234801134/)

13.) AMC is only $12 a share right now... Even if it loses, you’re only going to lose a bit. Meanwhile, the ceiling is high, and there is much potential. If you want in, do it now while it's cheap. People keep talking about how dumb it is to buy during the pandemic, but this is the point of largest potential. Don't wait for the recovery to buy.

14.) AMC used to trade at $10 before the pandemic. Let’s keep it at its former glory. AMC deserved a $1bn market cap and they got one. They will probably hit $20 tomorrow (predicting $25 by Feb1, peak in summer with COVID all done.).

15.) Even though the Net income is negative and they lose money, it consistently stays in the hundred thousands range, and it does not lose that much. Any autist on here from GME could pay the difference. [**AMC has also increased gross profits year over year, from 2,004,200 in 2016, to 3,493,200.**](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/amc)

*(The rest of these bullet points are just jokes, so feel free to skip if you want.)*

16.) Without AMC there’s no place to spend my AMC points, and there better be a place for me to spend those points because I invested my entire life savings into those damn AMC stubs.

17.) Going to the movies was my childhood. We must save my childhood. DO NOT LET AMC DIE. Save AMC.

18.) You can take ur wife and her bf to the movies when this is over.

19.) The AMC food court literally sells tendies. (But we should call AMC tendies popcorns instead.)

20.) **STONCCS only go up.**

21.) you guys are all retard who cannot think for themselves and will do whatever is echoed in this fucking internet cave.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

TL;DR : AMC has done a great job with fundraising and can survive until the end of the year. Vaccine rollout has started, and recovery is coming soon. People are due to return to movies. About 70% of shares are shorted, so we can potentially trigger a squeeze.

# Pandemic recovery &amp; squeeze combo.

**Buy AMC. Or don’t. Your choice.**

**If you’re with us, let's save the movies. I hope you like popcorn. Get on the rocket, because you're going to the moon.**

294,2021-02-26,0.0,ltenie,t3,1224.0,"(Trey's Trades here) - get this guys, let's do some quick configuration:

Gamma squeezes can be thought of very simply:

\-Buyers purchase contracts from Market Makers

\-Buyers gamma (essentially, potential to make money) goes up as the stock continues to climb and more call options are bought

\-Market makers, or the sellers, gamma initially goes down, and they want to mitigate this risk

\-If MANY people buy a crap ton of call options, the gamma goes up exponentially for retailers

\-If MANY people buy a crap ton of call options, the gamma goes down exponentially for market makers

&amp;#x200B;

\-Two things potentially happen:

1. Market makers hedge on the climb up by purchasing shares to raise their gamma and risk to lose money
2. Options expire ITM (in the money, or above the signified strike price), and option holders have the obligation to purchase the shares tied to their call options

Both these things drive the price up, so where am I going with this?

&amp;#x200B;

GME BEGAN ITS INSANE RUN-UP BECAUSE OF THIS BASIC, AND RIDICULOUSLY SIMPLE FUNDAMENTAL PHILOSOPHY! GME had a crap ton of call options purchased, raising gamma for retailers, dropping gamma for market makers, and they hedged on the climb up, raising price. Inevitably, call options expired in the money, raising price, AND LEADING to an eventual short squeeze.

DON'T FREAK OUT if AMC doesn't moon first thing in the morning. The setup is there. Stay convicted.

AMC has the same, exact, setup. Unusual options trading. 93.9% short utilization according to Ortex as of today. Low available short shares. The table is set, and all it'll take is a couple apes to keep eating some bananas.

The following paragraphs will layout the sources, as well as ground work for the fundamentals of this stock and what we know:

So lets begin, with the weekends end price 5.70; the price for AMC right now has solid support at 5.50 due to apes holding and buying up any phantom shares created by using calls (these synthetic shares are then borrowed by Hedge funds, diluting the the share pool, lowering the price at which they profit from shorts, however you beautiful apes have bought up those shares, and now they owe them to you; adding more fuel to the rocket).

Now let us discuss the short interest, right now there are a lot of conflicting sources of information with the exact short interest, such as with finrar, fintel, market watch and ortex; for the sake of this discussion we shall go with ortex, as well as market watch (via trey's trade: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SbyBuzoxeI&amp;list=PLZIPt\_aSfEw0wAV5cMTWqoaLWo1l0PQ-R&amp;index=15&amp;ab\_channel=Trey%27sTrades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SbyBuzoxeI&amp;list=PLZIPt_aSfEw0wAV5cMTWqoaLWo1l0PQ-R&amp;index=15&amp;ab_channel=Trey%27sTrades))

The data with ortex had the short utilization rate 91% (the amount of shorts that had been lent out, out of the possible pull was at 91% on feb 6th during short interest reporting).

Market watch had reported at the same time the short interest was 66% (rumors on reddit that I couldn't verify is that the actual short interest is over 100% using retail etfs, similar to GME), and furthermore amc still has a short volume of 66% on market watch ([https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc)), making it still one of the, if not highest in the world interms of short volume. As such I think we can confidently state that the short interest is at least &gt; 66%, best case above 100% already.

Now lets go over apes holding:

I understand there has been some confusion about whether 99.2% of the shares are actually being held; I'll be honest I can't verify that; here's what I can verify though, there is a high inflow within the stock for this quarter as well most apes are buying and holding; with [capital.com](https://capital.com/) ([https://capital.com/amc-entertainment-holdings-cl-a-share-price](https://capital.com/amc-entertainment-holdings-cl-a-share-price)) saying there are currently a 96/4 buy to sell ratio, this is backed up by fund inflows as show by market beat, as it shows massive inflows ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/institutional-ownership/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/institutional-ownership/)), backed up by a litany of institutional buyers like Vanguard, Blackrock, Charles swab, Morgan Stanley (the list is vast and you should totally check it out for yourself in the market beat link); in other words this stock has bullish confidence behind it, with not just apes buying and holding as such it is a legitimate investment and is worth buying and holding.

Furthermore as covered above in the short interest section, the phantom shares that have been diluting the share stock pile have been continuously bought and held by apes creating the hard support at 5.50. If this trend continues the price will inevitably increase.

Now before I sum it up, lets talk about Failure to Deliver data: [https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) , [https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/ll89bo/failure\_to\_deliver\_numbers\_out\_gme\_stocks\_not/?utm\_medium=android\_app&amp;utm\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/ll89bo/failure_to_deliver_numbers_out_gme_stocks_not/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

AMC allegedly has 54 Million shares that have failed to deliver at 4.98; I think this true but we still don't know when they have to buy and what exactly are the specifics, but what this does establish is that shorts eventually will have to buy at a higher price because there will not be enough shares to buy to payback the short loan of however many shares they are shorting, if apes hold. We just don't know what exactly is going on, but we know they have to cover; due to the SEC and it maybe a minimum of 54 mill shares they have to buy back at our price; which would cause insane volume, volatility and price action if it wasn't for the short ladder attacks, we shall use this information point when talking about the feedback loop that may take effect taking AMC to 2000.

Now lets review what we know so far, there seems to be a hard support at 5.50 regardless of naked shorting by phantom shares, due to apes holding and buying. This stock has been short laddered attack to 5.50 instead of organically going down; as such has a crazy high short interest of at least above 66% in a conservative estimate; without retail etf confirmation. Most apes are holding as shown by the buy: sell ratio, regardless of the 99.2% number, furthermore there is institutional confidence for AMC as such it is not only a short squeeze candidate, but a legitimate investment and good for a long term haul (we can discuss the amazon talks later, however birdbrain investing lays out a good case for a long term stock for AMC, and why its a 20 dollar stock [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hps4yjOxJ\_Y&amp;ab\_channel=BirdBrainInvesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hps4yjOxJ_Y&amp;ab_channel=BirdBrainInvesting)).

Now that we have established the fundamentals of the arguments, lets us elaborate how AMC could get to 2k and how. Right now with most technical factors (MacD, SMA, EMA etc) ; [https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/lodanb/amc\_10\_day\_forecast\_lets\_gooooooo\_source\_pretiming/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=ios\_app&amp;utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/lodanb/amc_10_day_forecast_lets_gooooooo_source_pretiming/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

AMC is on a bull run, and will increase; this will cause more volume, volatility and recent shorts to become unprofitable; as well as litany of option chain activity if strike prices are satisfied; taking more shares off the table as well as increasing short interest as more shorts will be opened.

I believe this will continue till 20, the question is will apes hold at 20. If apes hold at 20, then the shares they need to buy back on these now unprofitable short positions will be off the market, and they will have to ask for higher prices past 20 to try to get our shares. This will trigger even more aggressive options trading, increasing the demand for the stock even more, while taking away supply; increasing the price even more, until they fail to deliver and are given X amount of time by the SEC to either by back the stock, or declare bankruptcy and let insurance cover it at whatever price we want.

As such the series of events that will happen provided apes hold is as follows:

(FOR ANYBODY THAT DIDN'T READ THE BENCH MARK CASE, HERE IS THE FEEDBACK LOOP, CASE FOR THE FEEDBACK LOOP IS GIVEN ABOVE)

Apes hold and buy ---&gt; 20 bucks eventually ---&gt; apes buy and hold ---&gt; shorts become unprofitable and need to cover (short ladder attacks will happen don't panic, this will increase short interest) --&gt; options get struck allowing more shares to be taken off the market ---&gt; higher volatility ---&gt; higher price ---&gt;apes hold and buy --&gt; 40 bucks --&gt; same cycle ---&gt; this time with failure to delivers compounding ---&gt; apes hold and buy ---&gt; 80 bucks --&gt; S.C (same cycle) ---&gt; 200 --&gt; A.H.B (apes buy and hold) and media gets involved with ""GME 2 has appeared and its called AMC"" like headlines ---&gt; buying frenzy ---&gt; 400 --&gt; more media attention, more buying failure to delivers etc --&gt; 2000, until whatever price apes mass sell and failure to deliver is met.

The bedrock of this cycle is again, if we have been doing what we have been doing; buying and holding whatever they throw at us.

Now you ask, what are your past references you may ask; excellent question lets address the VW squeeze. ([https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/72zkab/what\_happens\_in\_a\_short\_squeeze/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/72zkab/what_happens_in_a_short_squeeze/))

In short 94 % ish of the VW stock if I recall was bought and held buy a combination of Porsche and the German government with a short interest of only 13%, as such the VW investors got to dictate prices to the Short sellers that had taken out short positions on VW, causing that insane price spike from 200 euros to 1k euros. As we have established in prior sections, AMC's short interest is much higher, and most shares maybe already off the table; as such the potential for this squeeze is much higher.

However this only gets to 2000 USD or higher, if apes hold like VW investors had, and now you may ask, why shouldn't I just take my profits and run, 200 bananas is plenty for an ape if an ape bought only 5 banana's, again good question, as such I'd recommend getting your original investment back when we hit a high level before the actual rocket launch (I think AMC based on that partial feedback loop/cycle is already inevitable) ; as such the worst that can possible happen is you double or triple your money as well as effectively having a spacesuit for the rocket launch; at what price you would like to gain your original investment (I think triple digits are inevitable, quadruple digits depend on the ape troop holding) back, and gain an effective spacesuit for the rocket launch.

If most apes take some profits and buy back as well, then 2k also becomes inevitable; however as stated this is how AMC can get to 2000.

To sum it up, it depends on apes buying holding, and price volatility driving prices higher and higher, making them uncoverable, as prices will be to high and there wont be enough shares, due to more people buying and options being struck, causing an effective positive price feedback cycle that was seen in GME; however this time they can't halt trading (they will increase margin requirements though so be aware of that).

Lastly, this feedback cycle depends entirely on apes holding, so like mark cuban said; we'll see what wallstreetbets is made of (or in this case AMC apes).

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and if you have read this and are bleeding hard; thanks for holding the line; like DFV said; hang in there

This piece is purely my opinion, and should not be taken for financial advice as it displays a hypothetical price action case for AMC that may happen; as such is not financial advice.

&amp;#x200B;

\*edit, as further recommended a TLDR for crayon eaters; if apes buy and hold they have no choice but to pay whatever price we want and the fact is everybody is holding, is an excellent sign this rocket ship could hit 2k, detailed mathematical and logical arguments are given above\*

The HF's have been throwing everything they have at us. Remember them trying to scare us into believing this stock would go back to the roughly $2.00 floor it was at? They've been playing every crooked, dirty little trick they have up their sleeves to try and make that happen too. But they have been unsuccessful. APES HELD STRONG. APES BOUGHT MORE! And the result is that the price we are at now $5.50-$5.60 is the new floor we have established and held on a lateral timeline for awhile now. That is a good sign. We are winning. We didn't let them push this down. We established a new floor. SOMETHING is going to happen with this stock before to much longer. It is just a matter of time and patience.

Disclaimer: None of the following is investment advice. Do your own research.

There's a lot of chatter about AMC and whether it'll pop or it'll dive. This is an attempt to establish the facts and figure out what's the roadmap to tendies from here on.

**tl;dr for those on a multicoloured crayon diet:**

**AMC is not dead, nor will it die anytime soon. There's plenty of positive catalysts coming up.**

**If you want to get in this play right away then better buy shares because IV is very high at the moment. $5 seems like a price floor. If you do want to buy calls I suggest Aug expiry between $7-$9, or better yet LEAPS Jan 22 at $10-$12.**

**My position is 15,000 shares at about $2.40. I'm waiting for IV to drop a bit before I buy LEAPS.**

Let's start at the beginning:

AMC is the largest movies operator in the world. It has 1,004 theatres and 11,041 screens worldwide. The biggest, by far. They made $43bn revenue for movie studios in 2019.

What we know from the Q3 2020 results:

After 5 months suspension of Operations theatres started to reopen.

First domestic theatres reopened 8/20 and int'l ones as early as June. However, most of Europe has been in lockdown since Nov/Dec 2020 and all domestics operate on a 20%-40% limited capacity. As of Oct 30th it operated 539/600 domestic locations and 261/358 int'l locations.

Record high scores in cleanliness of theatres.

March 2020 raised $900m in debt and equity. $1bn concessions from creditors and landlords, $80m asset sales.

* Q1 of 2020: drew down $325m from existing credit lines
* April 2020: issued $500m of debt due 2025. Suspended cash repurchase and dividends. Received $7m in tax cash refunds
* July 2020: debt exchange reduced debt by $555m, reduced interest expenses by $120m for one year (up to July 2022), extended maturities on $1.7bn of debt until 2026 and issued $300m of new debt due 2026.
* August 2020: sold Baltic region theatres for $77m.
* Sept 2020: sold 15m shares for $56.1m.
* Oct 2020: sold another 15m shares for $41.6m.
* Dec 2020: Prepared 50m shares for issuance, should they need to. Total shares outstanding on Dec 28 2020 were 164m Class A and 51.8m Class B.
* Jan 2021: Total shares outstanding as of Jan 22 2021 were 287,276,58 Class A and 51.8m Class B (Class B can't be sold unless converted to Class A).
* Jan 27th: SLA converts debt into equity and sells $600m worth of shares in the market. Total shares added to float: 44.4m. Debt reduced by $600m
* Feb 5th 2020: Wanda converted it's class B shares to class A shares. This means they can sell them in the market at any time now. There is no specific # on how many shares it converted, but we know it owned 51.8m of Class B shares.

Operationally they proceeded with layoffs and a series of cost cutting measures, renegotiated theatre leases, eliminate contractor roles and all sorts of expenses. **This is important as these savings will persist throughout the reopening of the theatres, so they will improve their profit margins going forward.**

**Cash position on 9/30: $417.9m**

**Total debt on 9/30: $5.82bn**

**Q&amp;A with myself**

**Are people really returning to theatres?**

Attendance was 6.5m tickets in Q3 2020 vs 87.1m in Q3 2019, representing about 7.5% of seating capacity, which was limited to about 20%-40% of total seats. While this may look like they are not utilizing their existing seating capacity, remember that theatre ops in USA were suspended for 2/3 of the 3rd quarter. I am guessing (no data) a similar restriction at the international theatres. Had ops not been suspended for 2/3 of Q3 then we'd be seeing roughly 3x the tickets, about 19.5m, or 22% of total seating capacity. That would suggest people were returning to cinemas before the end of Sept 2020. That's despite no blockbusters playing. **Only 2 films were released theatrically since mid-March to end of Sept and theatres were open mostly on weekends, so there wasn't much to watch anyway.**

**Are people spending at the theatres?**

Average ticket prices in Q3 2020 were $9.37 VS. $9.45 in Q3 2019, so pretty much the same.

In Int'l markets ticket prices were actually higher, at $9.80 vs $8.45.

Spending on food and beverage was the same in USA, at $5.35/patron in both Q3 2020 and Q3 2019, and higher in int'l markets ($4.10/patron vs. $3.59/patron in Q3 2019)

Again, that's positive in relation to how customers feel about AMC managing the cleaning of its theatres and safety practices. That level of spending suggests people are comfortable watching movies and eating/drinking in the theatres.

**From the Q3 ER call:**

The critical movie-leading markets of Los Angeles and New York City remain closed.

There has been massive focus on improving liquidity and deleveraging the balance sheet and cutting costs and spending. **A lot of those cost saving and spending cuts will continue even after revenue recovers,** which means higher profit margins, which means higher EPS, which means lower multiples to comps, which means share price will go up as it will be perceived as 'cheap'.

Stroke a deal with Universal for a PVOD window. Basically, that means that AMC will not exclusive rights to play movies for 74 days at theatres before the movie can go on video-on-demand. The time window is shortened, and after that you will have movies both on theatres and on demand online at the same time. AMC will take a cut for any movies that go on PVOD before the theatrical release period ends. As they said later in November, they have made more money with the PVOD deal than the standard exclusive theatrical release.

Theatre count in Middle East tripled in 2020, and it will further double in the first half of 2021.

Cash burn for Q3 2020 was $324m, inclusive of the costs for raising capital.

**44 major film titles have been rescheduled to play theatrically only in 2021. Once theatres reopen, say in summer, there will be a blockbuster every single week and some more.**

They have gotten out of 40 loss-making theatres in USA as well by not renewing leases.

**Breaking even?**

In 2019 AMC sold 17% of their available seats and had the biggest revenue/profit of any year ever. It all hinges to NYC and LA reopening basically as other individual theatres break even at 25% capacity. What this means is that you don't need COVID restrictions to lift fully before AMC starts making profits, you only need LA and NYC to reopen. This makes AMC a bit of a dark horse because most people will be waiting for full economy reopen before they jump at the stock, but its financials will be in the black long before then, and that means that it will most likely surprise upwards on ER going forward and exceed wallstreet's expectations.

**Innovation. Ok, they will reopen, but will they grow?**

They have launched a private theatre rental program, where you can book the whole auditorium. They have had 80,000 incquiries about it, and that's with a soft launch (no press releases yet or advertising).

There have been a lot of articles in the second half of 2020 about Amazon or Netflix partnering or buying them out. That would drive the price high instantly. Bear in mind that the streaming giants are facing pressure on growing their market share and AMC makes perfect sense. Also, given their balance sheets the financial risk of buying AMC out at roughly $2bn market cap is negligible.

**Won't streaming kill the movie theatres?**

No, absolutely not. AMC provided $43bn of revenue to film makers in 2019. No studio will forgo that kind of revenue. In fact, from the pilot testing of PVOD they've done, it's actually more lucrative for both theatres and studios to have a short exclusive theatrical release followed by concurrent streaming, than either/or. It's a new model of releasing movies and a much more profitable one. In summary, streaming will actually increase profits for AMC, not take away any.

**Ok, that may be true for the big blockbuster Avenger-type movies, but what about smaller releases? won't they be best stream-only?**

No, they have tested the PVOD deal with small releases (e.g. Kajilionaire which made under $10m revenue in cinemas) and the combined profit for studios/AMC was higher than the older model or what it'd have done streaming alone.

**Analyst ratings:**

According to marketbeat: 4 sell and 6 hold

AMC has the lowest, by far, P/E ratio against its competitors. This means it is perceived as cheap.

**Earnings date: 25 Feb**

&amp;#x200B;

**Major shareholders:**

* Blackrock 2.9% (increased it's position by 70%)
* Vanguard 4.5% (reduced its position slightly by -5%)
* Mittleman 1%
* Norther Trust 0.5% (increased position by 40%)
* Stifel 0.2% (increase position by 285%)
* Bank of NY Mellon 0.2%
* Wells Fargo 0.15%
* Charles Schwab 1% (increased its position by 10%)
* Goldman Sachs 0.6% (increased position by 160%)

**Risks:**

Further dilution in case AMC decides to sell more shares. This can be avoided if theatres start reopening faster or attendance picks up. With vaccinations underway in USA we should soon hear about LA and NYC reopening (NYC already lifte some restrictions in hospitality). People are worried about dilution, but do remember that shareholders were happy to pay high prices for those shares, so they believe they bought in cheap, and they aren't all idiots.

Debt holders pushing hard on AMC. However, this is unlikely to their benefit as any restructuring will take forever and they stand to lose a lot through a prolonged asset sale. It's preferable for debt holders to convert debt to equity and sell - and for that they'd need a good/high stock price.

Further COVID lockdowns because of new variants or whatnot

&amp;#x200B;

**Catalysts**:

Definite: Vaccination roll out means NYC and LA announce reopening of theatres soon.

Possible: Esports partnerships

Who knows: Buyout or partnership with Netflix, Amazon or Disney

**Other**

* Short interest remains high, I believe it was around 68% on 1/31, but someone may correct me if I got this wrong. In any positive newsflow the shorts will be pressed a bit.
* People are gagging to go to the cinema, AMC has had it's best revenue year after year up to 2019. They are not a dying business by any stretch of the imagination.

338,2021-02-01,0.0,l9zzek,t3,9064.0,"AMC and GME are experiencing the same bullish and bearish behaviours and thus experiencing some wild volatility. This is all because of the market makers so do not worry, as this is typical and was seen all last week. Even if more restrictions will hit just hold and we will bounce right back up if the consistency of the holders stay unchanged.

&amp;#x200B;

AMC going from +20% to remaining unchanged at 0% whilst GME goes to almost +10% and then remaining unchanged premarket at the exact same time will be the norm the coming time.

&amp;#x200B;

Best advice is: hold and buy more as this is just the same garbage as went on as a result of the big hedge funds getting hit in the end of last week. RobinHood are still the puppy of Citadel and will keep on making this as scary for new investors etc.

&amp;#x200B;

And of course, I am only telling you this because I like this stonk :).

Edit: I am all in on GME shares holding from 130.

Edit 2: no need to message me. Not a financial advisor. If you are worrired about any of the stocks on here the best thing to do IMO is to hold.

Edit 3: this is a short ladder. Just buy up paper hands and hold forever.

Edit 4: Check out the frontpage. 

""If you see GME falling quickly without volume , this isn't actual selloff of GME shares but a tactic of hedge funds to scare you into selling GME. Read this thread if you want to know more about this. The order book is filled with round number orders like 100 and 200, which is Citadel and Melvin just fucking with us.




DO NOT SELL.

342,2021-01-29,0.0,l8b814,t3,2563.0,"To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect AMC in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today’s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they’re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn’t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there’s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we’re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday 

My recommendation: 
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it’s going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it’s highest.",wallstreetbets,AMC heading to Mars next week buckle up everyone!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,2563.0,0.73

Hear me out here. I think Nano is going to make us all rich. It's what's gonna get us all a Tesla, plus a second Tesla to launch to Jupiter and beyond 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Altstreetbets, the crypto buddy of this holy sub, [is already dtf with this](https://np.reddit.com/r/AltStreetBets/comments/l66mhv/the_gme_case_for_nano/).

**# 1. What the f is Nano and why are you shilling this**

To keep it short for us retards: Nano is a cryptocurrency that boasts zero fees, instant transfers (sub-second), is green, and increases the size of your pp. It has a good claim to being better than Bitcoin but has 1/1500th its market cap. [Daddy Elon tweeted about whatever has least error &amp; latency will win](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1349977642708168704) \- that shit is literally what Nano is.

**# 2. We're in this together**

Apes together strong, right? Nano has a huge community, so big that most of the crypto subreddits aren't sure how to deal with the constant Nano enthusiasm. Not kidding, the banned Nanites could fill a subreddit by themselves. They're tireless on Reddit, Twitter, or anywhere else you dare utter that you pay fees for any crypto or money transfer. These are people that held through a 90% loss, then didn't sell when Nano suddenly pumped 400%. Diamond hands doesn't even begin to describe it. When the price pumped even slightly, they all jumped on it to pronounce Nano the best thing since before sliced bread, and went to town on Twitter and Reddit.

My point? **AMPLIFICATION**. As soon as Nano starts getting some price action, the Nanites will jump on it, will keep going, and they **ARE. NOT. LEAVING.**

**# 3. Rumours of Nano being suppressed**

The rumour that Nano is being suppressed by crypto miners and Bitcoin maximalists has been around for a very long time, and it makes sense. Nano works ridiculously well, and is there to eat the cake of all the miners who are raking in millions a day. BTC maxis and miners *hate* the word Nano, and have a strong incentive to literally pay to have it disappear from the face of the earth. Bitcoin influencers on Twitter have muted the word Nano because they know their thesis is fucked when it gets mentioned.

My point? **F EM**. Bitcoin is king, Bitcoin was literally birthed by the virgin Mary, and everything else is a 💩coin that doesn't deserve to pump. **F THAT**. And F maximalism in general. We're here to make money, and Bitcoin doesn't offer enough gains.

**# 4. Solid pumpamentals**

Aside from the strong community and the ridiculously good tech, it also has the other pumpamentals needed. It just got listed on AnchorUSD meaning it's now easy to buy in the US, and was recently added to KuCoin for 10x leveraged trading. Volume actively on the books on exchanges is low, right now it would take only $600k to pump it 30% on Binance pair. What else does it have as pumpamentals? The Nano team recently applied for the Coinbase listing and Coinbase just so happens to have removed pruning as a prerequisite from their website. Coincidence? Maybe, but when asked earlier Nano's lack of pruning was mentioned as the obstacle for a Coinbase listing. **COINS GETTING LISTED ON COINBASE ALWAYS PUMP BECAUSE COINBASE HAPPENS TO BUY A BUNCH OF WHATEVER THEY'RE LISTING BEFORE THEY LIST IT.**

Plus, it seems like we would have Raoul Pal from Real Vision Group in our camp. When he recently asked for altcoin recommendations the Nano Twitter shills did their job as usual, he replied to them it was a good thread. Coincidentally there was a huge (for Nano) buy order right around that time.

More pumpamentals? The Nano tagline writes itself. It transfers in the blink of an eye, it has no fees, it's greener than the big dildo that's currently fucking Melvin Capital, has the best wallet in all of crypto and can be demonstrated to anyone within a minute. It's the ultimate antidote to the high fees narrative of Bitcorn, and shames institutions for holding a CO2 emitting coal guzzler on their balance sheets through Bitcorn. As soon as the price starts going up, this thing sells itself. Hell, institutions can even buy it since recently through Bitcoin Suisse, where Nano was added because of demand. And keep in mind - this has a market cap of $450 million. Throwing $100 at Nano does more than throwing $1000 at AMC.

My point? Well, exactly the title. **SOLID PUMPAMENTALS**. Seriously this thing is so ready to be hyped.

**# 5. The plan**

Am I saying to leverage this x100 to pump it into the skies? Maybe, but also no. I am saying that whatever you do, Nano is going to pump anyway because if us retards can figure it out, others can too. This shit can be 10x leveraged on KuCoin without even needing to do KYC. I'm doing that right now, and am expecting you all to do the same. At a 3000% gain ($100) we can call this a success, if it gets to $250 I'll buy the top comment on this post a Tesla because fuck it, I'll be rich.

**My credentials?** My post karma when I posted this on another sub was 420. Due to the mass upvotes my total karma has now increased to 1337. I'm counting on this post shooting me to 42069. Need I say more?

Positivity, not disagreeing with anything I've said and more examples of solid pumpamentals (also places to leverage it more than 10x) are welcome in the comments ⬇

PROOF OR BAN [https://i.imgur.com/9eHQw6K.png](https://i.imgur.com/9eHQw6K.png)

Edit: **how to buy this shit?** Binance (5x leverage), Kucoin (10x leverage, can send crypto from other exchanges there and 10x leverage without KYC), or Kraken. If you got other crypto already, there's changenow. For Europe, Bitvavo is best.

Edit: Seems this shit is working, I'm currently up 80%. Don't worry, I'm not selling until this shit hits at least $250 so I can buy the top comment his Tesla.",Wallstreetbetsnew,"The case for Nano - a crypto YOLO with more upside than GME, NOK and AMC combined",1543.0,0.89
